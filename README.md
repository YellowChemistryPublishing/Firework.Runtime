# Firework.Runtime

A a blazing fast<sup>\[citation needed\]</sup>, lightweight game and application development library that is intuitive and easy to use, whilst also being performant and efficient.

This library is _very_ in-development right now, and definitely should not be used beyond experimentation. (Some commits might not even build!)

    For providing the algorithm to render arbitrary, concave polygons defined by `n` points in `O(n)` time. This algorithm has been extended in this library to support curved edges
    defined by quadratic beziers.
