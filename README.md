# Firework.Runtime

A a blazing fast<sup>\[citation needed\]</sup>, lightweight game and application development library that is intuitive and easy to use, whilst also being performant and efficient.

This library is _very_ in-development right now, and definitely should not be used beyond experimentation. (Some commits might not even build!)

Firework.Runtime currently comprises the following set of non-experimental libraries:

|                                   |                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Firework.Runtime.GL`             | The core graphics library all rendering is done through.          |
| `Firework.Runtime.RenderPipeline` | Let's you change rendering behaviour on the fly, if you'd like.   |
| `Firework.Runtime.CoreLib`        | The fundamentals--windowing, input, system events, ECS, and more! |
| `Firework.Components.Core2D`      | Basic 2D components you might want to use.                        |

As well as the following tools and examples:

|                                  |                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `example_visual_svg`             | Rendering scalable graphics from the `.svg` file.                         |
| `example_visual_text`            | See how you can draw text!                                                |
| `tool_packager`                  | The packaging utility to generate archives that can be loaded at runtime. |
| `cmake/package_archive.cmake`    | CMake include for creating a packaging target.                            |
| `cmake/precompile_shaders.cmake` | CMake include for creating a shader precompilation target.                |

-   _The authors, contributors, and engineers who have written the following..._

    -   `bgfx`

        Is what we use for all 2D and 3D graphics.

    -   `glm`

        For all our numerical math, including 2D and 3D matrix transformations required in rendering.

    -   `libcxxext`

        Small C++ additions that are lightly sprinkled throughout our code, to make a faster, safer, better library.

    -   `moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue`

        A general-purpose, multi-producer, multi-consumer, thread-safe queue, used mainly to communicate sequences of events between threads.

    -   `pugixml`

        Loads `.svg` files for us, and other XML files if you'd like!

    -   `robin-hood-hashing`

        An (although no longer in development), very fast set of hashmaps, that we prefer using.

    -   `SDL3`

        For window management, input handling, and much more!

    -   `stb`

        We use `stb_truetype` for the loading of OpenType fonts, and `stb_image` to load `.png` files.

    -   `std_function`

        An alternate implementation of a general-purpose function wrapper which is measurably faster than the common standard implementations. We like that.
